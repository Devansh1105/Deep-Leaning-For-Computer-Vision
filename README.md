I‚Äôm sharing my implementations from Stanford‚Äôs CS 231n course to showcase my hands-on experience with computer vision and deep learning fundamentals. Below is an overview of each assignment and its contents:

**üöÄ Assignment 1**: **Fundamentals with NumPy**
Built from scratch using vanilla NumPy:
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Softmax classifiers
A two-layer neural network

Focus: core concepts, loss functions, forward/backward passes

**‚öôÔ∏è Assignment 2: Deep Neural Networks & CNNs**
Expanded to:
Fully-connected neural networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Batch Normalization
Dropout regularization

Focus: training deeper architectures and improving generalization

**ü§ñ Assignment 3: Advanced Deep Learning Architectures**
Implemented advanced models, including:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Transformer-based captioning
RNN-based image captioning

Focus: generative and sequence modeling techniques
